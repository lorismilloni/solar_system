Solar System
Made in **25/01/2021**. (Only CSS remade with Bulma in june, 30, 2023)

## This is my first website using React.
#### I was learning to use .jsx extension, understand the 'render()' to make components, 'import' to bring functionalities from different sources, class Components, props and validations with PropTypes. The goal was to show the solar system planets and cards with space missions.
